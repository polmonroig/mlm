# mlm #

This is the repository for my Machine Learning Project Manager.
This application is divided into two parts. The C++ code, and the Python code. The C++ code is 
the heart of the manager, it is self suficient and necessary for all the procceses required 
for the project manager. On the other hand the Python package mlmpy inside the python_manager folder
is an API that facilitates the use of mlm through python, this way you don't have to leave your notebook or
python script. mlmpy does not work at all without the C++ package.
